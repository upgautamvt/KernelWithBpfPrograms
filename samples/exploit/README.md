### Toy example exploit for fun

An old example I showed in January. It does not really work under the current
infrastructure because only privileged users can load inner-unikernel programs.
But I guess it shows the importance of privileged-only inner-unikernel program.

```console
# ./loader # we are root in q by default, loader will set a non-root uid/gid 
$ id
uid=1000(jinghao) gid=1000(jinghao) groups=1000(jinghao)
$ ./exploit 
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```
